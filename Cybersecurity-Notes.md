## Networking

### IPV4 addresses</h3>
 * dotted decimal format
 * 4 octets (8 bits) separated by a decimal
 * The subnet mask def/ines the network part of the address and the hosts part of the address
 * The subnet mask divides the IP address into two parts. One part identifies the host, and the other the network to which it belongs.
 * The inverted binary subnet mask **added** to the binary network address creates a **sum** that is the binary equivalent of the broadcast address.

### IPV6 addresses

* hexadecimal format
* 128 bits long
