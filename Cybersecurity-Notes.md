## Networking

### IPV4 addresses</h3>
 * dotted decimal format*
 * 4 octets (8 bits) separated by a decimal
 * The subnet mask def/ines the network part of the address and the hosts part of the address
 * The subnet mask also controls the broadcast address _(I think)_

### IPV6 addresses

* hexadecimal format
* 128 bits long
