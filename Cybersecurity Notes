# Cybersecurity Notes

## Networking

### IPV4 addresses
	* dotted decimal format
	* 32 bits long
	* 4 octets (8 bits) separated by a decimal
	* The subnet mask defines the network part of the address and the hosts part of the address
	* The subnet mask also controls the broadcast address _I think_

### IPV6 addresses
	* hexadecimal format
	* 128 bits long
