- ### Confidentiality
  
   Relates to permitting authorized access to information while at the same time protecting information from improper disclosure.
This could include Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), or Classified or Secret materials, including trade secrets. business plans, or research. 
Sensitive information could also be included here. Information that, if revealed, could harm the company or individuals. 

- ### Integrity

   Is the property of information whereby it is recorded, used, and maintained in a way that ensures its completeness, accuracy, internal consistency, and usefulness for a stated purpose.
- ### Availability 

   Means that systems and data are accessible when users need them.
Ransomware attacks affect information availability for users.

# Authentication
There are three common methods of authentication
1. Passwords or passphrases
2. Tokens, Yubikeys, RSA keys, etc.
3. Biometrics

Using only one method of authentication in single-factor authentication (SFA). Granting access after demonstrating two or more of the above methods is multi-factor authentication (MFA).

# Non-repudiation
This is a way to prove that a user performed or did not perform an action. It ensures that people are held responsible for the transactions they participate in online. 

# Risk Management
First, we need a definition of  risk. It is  a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event. It is often expressed as a combination of:
1. the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs,  and
2. the likelihood of occurrence.

Information security risk reflects the potential adverse impacts that result from the possibility of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction of information and/or information systems. This definition represents that risk is associated with threats, impact and likelihood, and it also indicates that IT risk is a subset of business risk. 

Risk management terms we need to be familiar with:
- An **asset** is something in need of protection.
- A **vulnerability** is a gap or weakness in those protection efforts.
- A **threat** is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to thwart protection efforts.

**Threat actors** can include the following:
- Insiders (either deliberately, by simple human error, or by gross incompetence).
- Outside individuals or informal groups (either planned or opportunistic, discovering vulnerability).
- Formal entities that are nonpolitical (such as business competitors and cybercriminals).
- Formal entities that are political (such as terrorists, nation-states, and hacktivists).
- Intelligence or information gatherers (could be any of the above).
- Technology (such as free-running bots and artificial intelligence , which could be part of any of the above).

We must also consider the likelihood of an envent occuring and the impact of that event, both at the time of the event and in the aftermath. 

**Risk assessment** is defined as the process of identifying, estimating and prioritizing risks to an organization’s operations (including its mission, functions, image and reputation), assets, individuals, other organizations and even the nation. Risk assessment should result in aligning (or associating) each identified risk resulting from the operation of an information system with the goals, objectives, assets or processes that the organization uses, which in turn aligns with or directly supports achieving the organization’s goals and objectives. 

The result of the risk assessment process is often documented as a report or presentation given to management for their use in prioritizing the identified risk(s). This report is provided to management for review and approval. In some cases, management may indicate a need for a more in-depth or detailed risk assessment performed by internal or external resources.  

Risk treameent can be done in one of frour ways:
1. Avoidance - Risk avoidance is the decision to attempt to eliminate the risk entirely. This could include ceasing operation for some or all of the activities of the organization that are exposed to a particular risk. Organization leadership may choose risk avoidance when the potential impact of a given risk is too high or if the likelihood of the risk being realized is simply too great.
2. Mitigation - Risk mitigation is the most common type of risk management and includes taking actions to prevent or reduce the possibility of a risk event or its impact. Mitigation can involve remediation measures, or controls, such as security controls, establishing policies, procedures, and standards to minimize adverse risk. Risk cannot always be mitigated, but mitigations such as safety measures should always be in place.
3. Transfer - Risk transference is the practice of passing the risk to another party, who will accept the financial impact of the harm resulting from a risk being realized in exchange for payment. Typically, this is an insurance policy.
4. Risk acceptance is taking no action to reduce the likelihood of a risk occurring. Management may opt for conducting the business function that is associated with the risk without any further action on the part of the organization, either because the impact or likelihood of occurrence is negligible, or because the benefit is more than enough to offset that risk.
