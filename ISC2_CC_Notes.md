- ### Confidentiality
  
   Relates to permitting authorized access to information while at the same time protecting information from improper disclosure.
This could include Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), or Classified or Secret materials, including trade secrets. business plans, or research. 
Sensitive information could also be included here. Information that, if revealed, could harm the company or individuals. 

- ### Integrity

   Is the property of information whereby it is recorded, used, and maintained in a way that ensures its completeness, accuracy, internal consistency, and usefulness for a stated purpose.
- ### Availability 

   Means that systems and data are accessible when users need them.
Ransomware attacks affect information availability for users.

# Authentication
There are three common methods of authentication
1. Passwords or passphrases
2. Tokens, Yubikeys, RSA keys, etc.
3. Biometrics

Using only one method of authentication in single-factor authentication (SFA). Granting access after demonstrating two or more of the above methods is multi-factor authentication (MFA).

# Non-repudiation
This is a way to prove that a user performed or did not perform an action. It ensures that people are held responsible for the transactions they participate in online. 

# Risk Management
First, we need a definition of  risk. It is  a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event. It is often expressed as a combination of:
1. the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs,  and
2. the likelihood of occurrence.

Information security risk reflects the potential adverse impacts that result from the possibility of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction of information and/or information systems. This definition represents that risk is associated with threats, impact and likelihood, and it also indicates that IT risk is a subset of business risk. 

Risk management terms we need to be familiar with:
- An **asset** is something in need of protection.
- A **vulnerability** is a gap or weakness in those protection efforts.
- A **threat** is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to thwart protection efforts.

**Threat actors** can include the following:
- Insiders (either deliberately, by simple human error, or by gross incompetence).
- Outside individuals or informal groups (either planned or opportunistic, discovering vulnerability).
- Formal entities that are nonpolitical (such as business competitors and cybercriminals).
- Formal entities that are political (such as terrorists, nation-states, and hacktivists).
- Intelligence or information gatherers (could be any of the above).
- Technology (such as free-running bots and artificial intelligence , which could be part of any of the above).
